Cool… but why are we learning about Docker?
We can easily scale an application using a cluster of 
containers on one or more machines

We can easily share our application with others 
for testing & development

We can build a template for our application 
called an image

We can automate the process of building & 
deploying that image with docker compose

We can run the same application on any machine 
without worrying about performance or incompatibilites

Having psycopg issues on your M1? Use a Docker container!
